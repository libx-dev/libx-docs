# Version Management

Learn how to effectively manage multiple versions of your documentation, from planning version strategy to maintaining historical content.

## Version Strategy

### When to Create New Versions

Create new documentation versions when:

- **Major API changes**: Breaking changes that affect user implementation
- **Significant feature additions**: New functionality that changes workflows
- **Platform updates**: Major platform or framework upgrades
- **Audience changes**: Different user types requiring different approaches

### Version Lifecycle

Typical version lifecycle:

1. **Development**: Version under active development
2. **Current/Latest**: Primary supported version
3. **Maintenance**: Receives critical updates only
4. **Deprecated**: No longer updated, archived for reference
5. **Archived**: Removed from main navigation, accessible via direct links

## Configuration

### Version Definition

Define versions in `project.config.ts`:

```typescript
versions: [
  { 
    id: 'v1', 
    name: 'Version 1.0', 
    date: new Date('2024-01-01'), 
    isLatest: false 
  },
  { 
    id: 'v2', 
    name: 'Version 2.0', 
    date: new Date('2025-01-01'), 
    isLatest: true 
  }
] as Version[]
```

### Directory Structure

Organize content by version:

```
src/content/docs/
├── en/
│   ├── v1/                 # Version 1 content
│   │   └── guide/
│   │       └── getting-started.mdx
│   └── v2/                 # Version 2 content
│       ├── guide/
│       ├── components/
│       └── reference/
└── ja/                     # Japanese translations
    ├── v1/
    └── v2/
```

## Creating New Versions

### Using the Version Script

Create a new version with the built-in script:

```bash
node scripts/create-version.js sample-docs v3
```

This script:

1. **Updates configuration**: Adds new version to `project.config.ts`
2. **Creates directories**: Sets up folder structure for all languages
3. **Generates index pages**: Creates version-specific landing pages
4. **Copies content**: Optionally copies from previous version as starting point
5. **Updates metadata**: Sets new version as latest

### Manual Version Creation

For more control, create versions manually:

#### 1. Update Configuration

Add the new version to `project.config.ts`:

```typescript
versions: [
  // Existing versions
  { 
    id: 'v1', 
    name: 'Version 1.0', 
    date: new Date('2024-01-01'), 
    isLatest: false 
  },
  { 
    id: 'v2', 
    name: 'Version 2.0', 
    date: new Date('2025-01-01'), 
    isLatest: false      // No longer latest
  },
  // New version
  { 
    id: 'v3', 
    name: 'Version 3.0', 
    date: new Date('2025-06-01'), 
    isLatest: true       // New latest version
  }
]
```

#### 2. Create Directory Structure

Create directories for each supported language:

```bash
mkdir -p src/content/docs/en/v3/guide
mkdir -p src/content/docs/en/v3/components
mkdir -p src/content/docs/en/v3/reference
mkdir -p src/content/docs/ja/v3/guide
mkdir -p src/content/docs/ja/v3/components
mkdir -p src/content/docs/ja/v3/reference
```

#### 3. Create Initial Content

Start with a version-specific getting started guide:

```yaml
---
title: "What's New in v3"
description: "Explore the new features and improvements in version 3"
category: "guide"
order: 1
---
```

```markdown
# What's New in Version 3

Welcome to version 3! This release introduces significant improvements...

## Breaking Changes

### API Updates
- Method `oldMethod()` has been replaced with `newMethod()`
- Configuration structure has changed

### Migration Guide
Follow these steps to upgrade from v2:

1. Update your configuration files
2. Replace deprecated method calls
3. Test your implementation

## New Features

### Enhanced Performance
Version 3 is 40% faster than v2...

### New Components
We've added several new UI components...

## Getting Started

If you're new to our documentation system, start with:
- [Basic concepts](/en/v3/guide/concepts)
- [Installation guide](/en/v3/guide/installation)
- [First project](/en/v3/guide/first-project)

## Migrating from v2

Existing v2 users should read:
- [Migration guide](/en/v3/guide/migration)
- [Breaking changes](/en/v3/reference/breaking-changes)
- [Compatibility notes](/en/v3/reference/compatibility)
```

## Version Navigation

### Version Selector

Users can switch between versions using the built-in version selector component. This appears in the navigation bar and allows quick switching while maintaining the current page context when possible.

### Cross-Version Linking

Link between versions when content is related:

```markdown
<!-- In v2 documentation -->
This feature has been improved in [version 3](/en/v3/guide/improved-feature).

<!-- In v3 documentation -->
This replaces the v2 approach documented [here](/en/v2/guide/old-approach).
```

### URL Structure

Version URLs follow a consistent pattern:

```
/{language}/{version}/{category}/{document}

Examples:
/en/v2/guide/getting-started
/ja/v3/components/icons
/en/v1/reference/api
```

## Content Migration Strategies

### Full Migration

Copy all content from previous version and update:

```bash
# Copy v2 to v3
cp -r src/content/docs/en/v2/* src/content/docs/en/v3/

# Update all frontmatter and content for v3
# Update version-specific links and examples
```

### Selective Migration

Migrate only relevant content:

1. **Identify evergreen content**: Concepts that don't change between versions
2. **Update changed content**: Rewrite sections with version-specific changes
3. **Add new content**: Document new features and capabilities
4. **Remove obsolete content**: Don't carry forward outdated information

### Progressive Enhancement

Start with basics and expand over time:

1. **Launch with minimal content**: Getting started and key changes
2. **Migrate popular pages**: Focus on most-visited content first
3. **Fill content gaps**: Add missing documentation based on user needs
4. **Enhance with examples**: Improve with better examples and use cases

## Maintenance Workflow

### Version Support Matrix

Define support levels for each version:

| Version | Status | Updates | End of Life |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| v3 | Current | All updates | TBD |
| v2 | Maintenance | Critical fixes only | 2026-01-01 |
| v1 | Deprecated | Security fixes only | 2025-06-01 |

### Update Strategy

**Current Version (v3)**:
- Regular content updates
- New feature documentation
- Performance improvements
- User experience enhancements

**Maintenance Version (v2)**:
- Critical bug fixes
- Security updates
- Important clarifications
- No new features

**Deprecated Version (v1)**:
- Security fixes only
- Clear deprecation notices
- Migration guidance
- Minimal maintenance

### Deprecation Process

When deprecating a version:

1. **Announce deprecation**: Clear communication about timeline
2. **Add notices**: Prominent deprecation warnings on all pages
3. **Provide migration path**: Clear upgrade instructions
4. **Set end-of-life date**: Specific date when support ends
5. **Archive gracefully**: Keep content accessible but remove from navigation

## Best Practices

### Content Strategy

- **Maintain consistency**: Use similar structure across versions
- **Plan migration paths**: Clear upgrade instructions between versions
- **Document breaking changes**: Comprehensive change logs
- **Preserve context**: Explain why changes were made

### User Experience

- **Default to latest**: New users should see current version
- **Preserve user choice**: Remember version preference
- **Clear version indicators**: Always show which version user is viewing
- **Smooth transitions**: Handle missing pages gracefully when switching versions

### Technical Considerations

- **URL stability**: Don't break existing links unnecessarily
- **Search optimization**: Ensure search works across versions
- **Performance**: Don't load unnecessary version data
- **Analytics**: Track usage patterns across versions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Broken links between versions**:
- Solution: Use version-agnostic links where possible, or update links when content moves

**Outdated content in old versions**:
- Solution: Add prominent notices linking to current version

**User confusion about versions**:
- Solution: Clear version indicators and better onboarding

**Search returning outdated results**:
- Solution: Weight current version higher in search results
