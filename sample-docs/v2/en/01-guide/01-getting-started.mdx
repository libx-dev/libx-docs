# Documentation Creation Basics

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation guide! This section will teach you everything you need to know about creating, editing, and managing documentation effectively.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive guide, you'll discover:

- **Document Creation**: How to create new documents with proper structure
- **Content Organization**: Best practices for organizing and categorizing content
- **Component Usage**: How to use built-in UI components to enhance your documentation
- **Advanced Features**: Automation, customization, and deployment strategies

## Documentation Philosophy

Good documentation should be:

1. **Clear and Concise**: Easy to understand and follow
2. **Well-Organized**: Logical structure and navigation
3. **Comprehensive**: Covers all necessary topics
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to update and keep current
5. **Accessible**: Available to all users regardless of ability

## Getting Started Checklist

Before you begin creating documentation, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Development Environment**: Node.js 18+, pnpm, and a code editor
- [ ] **Project Understanding**: Familiarity with the project structure
- [ ] **Content Plan**: Clear idea of what you want to document
- [ ] **Audience Awareness**: Understanding of who will read your documentation

## Project Structure Overview

This documentation system is organized as follows:

```
src/content/docs/
├── en/                    # English documentation
│   ├── v1/               # Version 1 (simple intro)
│   └── v2/               # Version 2 (comprehensive)
│       ├── guide/        # Step-by-step guides
│       ├── components/   # UI component examples
│       ├── advanced/     # Advanced topics
│       └── reference/    # Reference materials
└── ja/                   # Japanese documentation
    ├── v1/
    └── v2/
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Sidebar Generation
The documentation system automatically generates sidebar navigation based on your content structure and frontmatter configuration.

### Multi-language Support
Content can be created in multiple languages with automatic language switching and URL management.

### Component Integration
Rich UI components are available to enhance your documentation with interactive elements, code examples, and visual aids.

### Version Management
Multiple versions of documentation can be maintained simultaneously, allowing for gradual migration and historical reference.

## Content Creation Workflow

The typical workflow for creating documentation involves:

1. **Planning**: Define the scope and structure of your content
2. **Creating**: Write the initial content using Markdown and MDX
3. **Enhancing**: Add components, examples, and interactive elements
4. **Organizing**: Set up proper categories and navigation
5. **Testing**: Verify links, formatting, and functionality
6. **Publishing**: Deploy and make available to users

## Writing Guidelines

When creating documentation:

- **Start with the user's goal**: What are they trying to accomplish?
- **Use clear headings**: Create a logical hierarchy of information
- **Include examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Be consistent**: Use the same terminology and formatting throughout
- **Test everything**: Verify that instructions actually work
