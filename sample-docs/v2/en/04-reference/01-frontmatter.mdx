# Frontmatter Reference

Complete reference for frontmatter properties available in documentation files. This documentation system uses a minimalist approach focusing on essential metadata only.

## Required Properties

### title
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** The title of the document, displayed in navigation and page headers
- **Usage:** Should be descriptive and unique within the documentation

```yaml
title: "Getting Started Guide"
```

### description
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** Brief description used for SEO meta tags and content previews
- **Usage:** Should be 50-160 characters for optimal SEO

```yaml
description: "Learn how to get started with our documentation system"
```

## Automatic Features

This documentation system automatically handles many aspects that traditionally require manual frontmatter configuration:

### Navigation
- **Previous/Next links**: Automatically generated based on file structure and numbering
- **Category organization**: Derived from directory structure
- **Ordering**: Based on file naming convention (01-, 02-, etc.)

### Metadata
- **Publication dates**: Managed through Git history
- **Author information**: Tracked via Git commits
- **Update dates**: Automatically updated based on file modifications

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
Content organization is handled through the file system structure:

```
src/content/docs/[lang]/[version]/[category]/[document].mdx
```

- **Categories** are automatically detected from directory names
- **Ordering** is controlled by numerical prefixes (01-, 02-, etc.)
- **Navigation** is generated based on file structure

### Naming Convention

Use numbered prefixes to control document order:

```
01-getting-started.mdx    # First document
02-installation.mdx       # Second document
03-configuration.mdx      # Third document
```

### Categories

Standard categories used in this system:

- `01-guide/` - Step-by-step tutorials and getting started content
- `02-components/` - UI component documentation and examples  
- `03-advanced/` - Advanced topics and customization
- `04-reference/` - API references and detailed specifications

## Example Usage

Here's the recommended minimal frontmatter for most documents:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Document Title"
description: "A brief description of what this document covers"
---
```

This simple approach provides all the essential metadata while relying on the system's automatic features for organization and navigation.

## Best Practices

### Title Guidelines
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich titles
- Keep titles concise but informative
- Ensure titles are unique within each section

### Description Guidelines  
- Keep descriptions between 50-160 characters for optimal SEO
- Write clear, actionable descriptions
- Focus on what the user will learn or accomplish

### File Organization
- Use numbered prefixes to control ordering (01-, 02-, etc.)
- Group related content in appropriate directories
- Follow consistent naming conventions across all documents

This minimalist approach reduces maintenance overhead while ensuring all essential information is captured efficiently.
