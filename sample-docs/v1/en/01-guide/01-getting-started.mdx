# Documentation Versioning Overview

Welcome to the sample documentation project! This guide explains the concept of documentation versioning and how you can organize content across different versions like v1 and v2.

## What is Documentation Versioning?

Documentation versioning allows you to maintain multiple versions of your documentation simultaneously. This is particularly useful when:

- You have different versions of your software or API
- You need to support users on older versions while developing new features
- You want to gradually migrate users from one version to another
- You need to maintain backward compatibility documentation

## Why Separate v1 and v2?

In this project, we demonstrate versioning by organizing content into separate directories:

```
docs/
├── en/
│   ├── v1/           # Version 1 documentation
│   │   └── guide/
│   └── v2/           # Version 2 documentation
│       ├── guide/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── advanced/
│       └── reference/
└── ja/               # Japanese translations
    ├── v1/
    └── v2/
```

### Version 1 (Current Page)
- **Purpose**: Provides a simple introduction to the versioning concept
- **Content**: Basic overview and orientation
- **Audience**: Users getting familiar with the documentation structure

### Version 2 (Main Documentation)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation with detailed guides and examples
- **Content**: Complete documentation creation and editing guides
- **Audience**: Users ready to create and manage documentation

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clear Separation**: Each version has its own dedicated space
2. **Independent Evolution**: Versions can evolve independently
3. **User Choice**: Users can choose the version that fits their needs
4. **Migration Path**: Clear progression from basic to advanced content

## Directory Structure Benefits

By organizing content in version-specific directories, you get:

- **Organized URLs**: Clean paths like `/en/v1/guide/` and `/en/v2/guide/`
- **Independent Navigation**: Each version can have its own sidebar structure
- **Flexible Content**: Different versions can have completely different content organization
- **Easy Maintenance**: Changes to one version don't affect others

## Multi-language Support

This versioning approach works seamlessly with multi-language support:

- Each language (`en`, `ja`) has its own version directories
- Content can be translated independently for each version
- URL structure remains clean and predictable
- Users can switch languages while staying in the same version

## Technical Implementation

This versioning system is built using:

- **Directory-based routing**: Astro's file-based routing system
- **Dynamic sidebar generation**: Automatically generates navigation based on content structure
- **Frontmatter configuration**: Uses metadata to control ordering and categorization
- **Multi-language support**: Built-in internationalization features

The version information is configured in `project.config.ts`, where you can:
- Define available versions
- Set the latest version
- Configure version-specific metadata
- Manage version display names and dates
